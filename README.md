## C1

	### Karatsuba Multiplication
	- Divide and conquer strategy for 2 digit multiplication
	- First multiplication algorithm faster than traditional by hand method.
	- Substitutes multiplication of 2 numbers n digit for 3 multiplications of n/2 digit numbers + quick overhead.

	### Merge Sort
	- Divide and conquer sorting
	- Count inversions

	### Quick Sort
	- Divide and conquer sorting
	- Multiple pivot strategies implemented

	### Karger's Minimum Cut Algorithm
	- Randomized algorithm for determining a graph's minimum cut
	- Wrong most of the time, but fast and significantly better than random so iteration is required.


## C2

	### Kosaraju's Algorithm
	- finds the strongly connected components of a directed graph
	- 2 traversals of graph (linear time)
	
	### Dijkstra's Shortest Path
	- finds shortest paths between nodes in a graph
	
	### kth median
	- Return the median value of the first k elements in an array.
	- Minimum and maximum heap implementation
	
	### 2sum
	- Calculate number of unique values that can be calculated from adding 2 elements from a list.

## C3 

	### Prim's MST Algorithm
	- Greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
	- Faster than Kruskal for dense graphs
	- Maintains a single connected component, growing one vertex at time.
	
	### Job scheduling
	- Greedy resource scheduling
	
	### Kruskal's 
	- Greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
	- Faster than Prim for sparse graphs
	- Builds multiple components independently, always connecting them eventually if possible.
	
	### Hamming distance
	- Efficient clustering in large graph. Hamming distance used for distance metric.
